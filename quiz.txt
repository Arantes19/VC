How many bytes will a grayscale image, 8bpp, with a resolution of 320x240 occupy in memory?

R:  Size_in_bytes = width * height * bit_depth
    Size_in_bytes = 320 * 240 * 8 
    Size_in_bytes = 768,000 bytes


How many bytes will a binary image, 1bpp, with a resolution of 320x240 occupy in memory?

R:  Size_in_bytes = width * height * bit_depth
    Size_in_bytes = 320 * 240 * 1
    Size_in_bytes = 76,800 bytes


How many bytes will a binary image, 8bpp, with a resolution of 320x240 occupy in memory?

R:  A binary image typically only requires 1 bit per pixel.


Declare, using the data types of the C language, an array capable of storing a grayscale image, 8bpp, with a resolution of 704x576 pixels.

R:  unsigned char grayscale_image[704][576];
